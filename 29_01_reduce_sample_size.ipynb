    "## Methodology: Sample Size Sensitivity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "Determine the most suitable sample size for geostatistical interpolation of soil organic carbon mass (C_mass) in peatlands using Empirical Bayesian Kriging (EBK).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data and Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Original Dataset**\n",
    "The original dataset comprises 190 geological cores from two sources:\n",
    "- 20 cores from Vrije Universiteit (VU)\n",
    "- 170 cores from DINOloket national database\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Sample Size Reduction**\n",
    "Five random subsamples were extracted from the original 190 cores with varying percentages:\n",
    "- 10% (n = 19 cores)\n",
    "- 25% (n = 48 cores)\n",
    "- 50% (n = 95 cores)\n",
    "- 75% (n = 143 cores)\n",
    "- 90% (n = 171 cores)\n",
    "\n",
    "All subsamples were generated using a fixed random seed (`random_state=42+percentage`) to ensure reproducibility across runs. This approach guarantees that:\n",
    "- Results are reproducible and verifiable\n",
    "- Differences in interpolation quality reflect sample size effects, not random variation\n",
    "- The methodology can be replicated by other researchers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Processing**\n",
    "Each subsample was:\n",
    "1. Saved as an individual shapefile\n",
    "2. Imported into ArcGIS Pro\n",
    "3. Used as input for Empirical Bayesian Kriging (EBK) interpolation with cross-validation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4: Comparison and Analysis**\n",
    "The interpolation quality for each subsample was evaluated based on:\n",
    "- Cross-validation statistics (RMSE, Mean Error)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rationale\n",
    "By comparing interpolation results across different sample sizes, we could identify the optimal balance between data density and prediction accuracy, ensuring the geostatistical method produces reliable C_mass distribution maps without requiring excessive field data.\n",
