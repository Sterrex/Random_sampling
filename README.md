# Random_sampling
This is a python script to makes 5 files with random sampling to adress the reliability with cross-validation. This script provides the tool to automatically reduce the sample size of the geological cores to 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 90%. The outcome is 5 new files containing
random samples sizes.  With these multiple reduces sample sizes the geostatistics can be taken under the look to decide what sample size is the most suitable for this methodology.
The source data includes 190 geological cores from the VU and DINOloket. These 5 sensitiviy files are used to import them in the excisting script to calculate the prediction of the C_mass and
see how the results of the interpolation with different amount of cores differ according to geostatistics.
